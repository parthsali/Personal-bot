The order is library defaults found in [lib/defaults.js](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/master/lib/defaults/index.js#L28), then `defaults` property of the instance, and finally `config` argument for the request. The latter will take preceden", "ent for the request. The latter will take precedence over the former. Here's an example.\n\n```js\n// Create an instance using the config defaults provided by the library\n// At this point the timeout config value is `0` as is the default for the library\nconst instance = axios.create();\n\n// Override timeout default for the library\n// Now all requests using this instance will wait 2.5 seconds before timing out\ninstance.defaults.timeout = 2500;\n\n// Override timeout for this request as it's known to take a long ti", "t for this request as it's known to take a long time\ninstance.get('/longRequest', {\n  timeout: 5000\n});\n```\n\n## Interceptors\n\nYou can intercept requests or responses before they are handled by `then` or `catch`.\n\n```js\n// Add a request interceptor\naxios.interceptors.request.use(function (config) {\n    // Do something before request is sent\n    return config;\n  }, function (error) {\n    // Do something with request error\n    return Promise.reject(error);\n  });\n\n// Add a response interceptor\naxios.interceptor", ";\n\n// Add a response interceptor\naxios.interceptors.response.use(function (response) {\n    // Any status code that lie within the range of 2xx cause this function to trigger\n    // Do something with response data\n    return response;\n  }, function (error) {\n    // Any status codes that falls outside the range of 2xx cause this function to trigger\n    // Do something with response error\n    return Promise.reject(error);\n  });\n```\n\nIf you need to remove an interceptor later you can.\n\n```js\nconst myInterceptor", "erceptor later you can.\n\n```js\nconst myInterceptor = axios.interceptors.request.use(function () {/*...*/});\naxios.interceptors.request.eject(myInterceptor);\n```\n\nYou can also clear all interceptors for requests or responses.\n```js\nconst instance = axios.create();\ninstance.interceptors.request.use(function () {/*...*/});\ninstance.interceptors.request.clear(); // Removes interceptors from requests\ninstance.interceptors.response.use(function () {/*...*/});\ninstance.interceptors.response.clear(); // Removes int", "ance.interceptors.response.clear(); // Removes interceptors from responses\n```\n\nYou can add interceptors to a custom instance of axios.\n\n```js\nconst instance = axios.create();\ninstance.interceptors.request.use(function () {/*...*/});\n```\n\nWhen you add request interceptors, they are presumed to be asynchronous by default. This can cause a delay\nin the execution of your axios request when the main thread is blocked (a promise is created under the hood for\nthe interceptor and your request gets put on the botto", "interceptor and your request gets put on the bottom of the call stack). If your request interceptors are synchronous you can add a flag\nto the options object that will tell axios to run the code synchronously and avoid any delays in request execution.\n\n```js\naxios.interceptors.request.use(function (config) {\n  config.headers.test = 'I am only a header!';\n  return config;\n}, null, { synchronous: true });\n```\n\nIf you want to execute a particular interceptor based on a runtime check,\nyou can add a `runWhen` fu", "sed on a runtime check,\nyou can add a `runWhen` function to the options object. The interceptor will not be executed **if and only if** the return\nof `runWhen` is `false`. The function will be called with the config\nobject (don't forget that you can bind your own arguments to it as well.) This can be handy when you have an\nasynchronous request interceptor that only needs to run at certain times.\n\n```js\nfunction onGetCall(config) {\n  return config.method === 'get';\n}\naxios.interceptors.request.use(function (", "'get';\n}\naxios.interceptors.request.use(function (config) {\n  config.headers.test = 'special get headers';\n  return config;\n}, null, { runWhen: onGetCall });\n```\n\n### Multiple Interceptors\n\nGiven you add multiple response interceptors\nand when the response was fulfilled\n- then each interceptor is executed\n- then they are executed in the order they were added\n- then only the last interceptor's result is returned\n- then every interceptor receives the result of its predecessor\n- and when the fulfillment-interc", " its predecessor\n- and when the fulfillment-interceptor throws\n    - then the following fulfillment-interceptor is not called\n    - then the following rejection-interceptor is called\n    - once caught, another following fulfill-interceptor is called again (just like in a promise chain).\n\nRead [the interceptor tests](./test/specs/interceptors.spec.js) for seeing all this in code.\n\n## Error Types\n\nThere are many different axios error messages that can appear that can provide basic information about the specif", "hat can provide basic information about the specifics of the error and where opportunities may lie in debugging.\n\nThe general structure of axios errors is as follows:\n| Property  | Definition  |\n| -------- | ----------  |\n| message  | A quick summary of the error message and the status it failed with. |\n| name     | This defines where the error originated from. For axios, it will always be an 'AxiosError'. |\n| stack    | Provides the stack trace of the error. | \n| config   | An axios config object with spec", ". | \n| config   | An axios config object with specific instance configurations defined by the user from when the request was made |\n| code     | Represents an axios identified error. The table below lists out specific definitions for internal axios error.  |\n| status   | HTTP response status code. See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) for common HTTP response status code meanings. \n\nBelow is a list of potential axios identified error\n| Code  |  Definition   |\n| -------- | -----", "error\n| Code  |  Definition   |\n| -------- | ----------  |\n| ERR_BAD_OPTION_VALUE | Invalid or unsupported value provided in axios configuration. |\n| ERR_BAD_OPTION | Invalid option provided in axios configuration. |\n| ECONNABORTED | Request timed out due to exceeding timeout specified in axios configuration. |\n| ETIMEDOUT | Request timed out due to exceeding default axios timelimit. |\n| ERR_NETWORK | Network-related issue.\n| ERR_FR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS | Request is redirected too many times; exceeds max redi", "est is redirected too many times; exceeds max redirects specified in axios configuration.\n| ERR_DEPRECATED | Deprecated feature or method used in axios. \n| ERR_BAD_RESPONSE | Response cannot be parsed properly or is in an unexpected format. \n| ERR_BAD_REQUEST | Requested has unexpected format or missing required parameters. |\n| ERR_CANCELED | Feature or method is canceled explicitly by the user.   \n| ERR_NOT_SUPPORT | Feature or method not supported in the current axios environment. \n| ERR_INVALID_URL | Inv", "urrent axios environment. \n| ERR_INVALID_URL | Invalid URL provided for axios request.\n\n## Handling Errors\n\nthe default behavior is to reject every response that returns with a status code that falls out of the range of 2xx and treat it as an error.\n\n```js\naxios.get('/user/12345')\n  .catch(function (error) {\n    if (error.response) {\n      // The request was made and the server responded with a status code\n      // that falls out of the range of 2xx\n      console.log(error.response.data);\n      console.log(", "nsole.log(error.response.data);\n      console.log(error.response.status);\n      console.log(error.response.headers);\n    } else if (error.request) {\n      // The request was made but no response was received\n      // `error.request` is an instance of XMLHttpRequest in the browser and an instance of\n      // http.ClientRequest in node.js\n      console.log(error.request);\n    } else {\n      // Something happened in setting up the request that triggered an Error\n      console.log('Error', error.message);\n    }", "r\n      console.log('Error', error.message);\n    }\n    console.log(error.config);\n  });\n```\n\nUsing the `validateStatus` config option, you can override the default condition (status >= 200 && status < 300) and define HTTP code(s) that should throw an error.\n\n```js\naxios.get('/user/12345', {\n  validateStatus: function (status) {\n    return status < 500; // Resolve only if the status code is less than 500\n  }\n})\n```\n\nUsing `toJSON` you get an object with more information about the HTTP error.\n\n```js\naxios.get", "information about the HTTP error.\n\n```js\naxios.get('/user/12345')\n  .catch(function (error) {\n    console.log(error.toJSON());\n  });\n```\n\n## Cancellation\n\n### AbortController\n\nStarting from `v0.22.0` Axios supports AbortController to cancel requests in fetch API way:\n\n```js\nconst controller = new AbortController();\n\naxios.get('/foo/bar', {\n   signal: controller.signal\n}).then(function(response) {\n   //...\n});\n// cancel the request\ncontroller.abort()\n```\n\n### CancelToken `\ud83d\udc4edeprecated`\n\nYou can also cancel a ", " CancelToken `\ud83d\udc4edeprecated`\n\nYou can also cancel a request using a *CancelToken*.\n\n> The axios cancel token API is based on the withdrawn [cancellable promises proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-cancelable-promises).\n\n> This API is deprecated since v0.22.0 and shouldn't be used in new projects\n\nYou can create a cancel token using the `CancelToken.source` factory as shown below:\n\n```js\nconst CancelToken = axios.CancelToken;\nconst source = CancelToken.source();\n\naxios.get('/user/12345', {\n  cancelToken", "ource();\n\naxios.get('/user/12345', {\n  cancelToken: source.token\n}).catch(function (thrown) {\n  if (axios.isCancel(thrown)) {\n    console.log('Request canceled', thrown.message);\n  } else {\n    // handle error\n  }\n});\n\naxios.post('/user/12345', {\n  name: 'new name'\n}, {\n  cancelToken: source.token\n})\n\n// cancel the request (the message parameter is optional)\nsource.cancel('Operation canceled by the user.');\n```\n\nYou can also create a cancel token by passing an executor function to the `CancelToken` construc", "an executor function to the `CancelToken` constructor:\n\n```js\nconst CancelToken = axios.CancelToken;\nlet cancel;\n\naxios.get('/user/12345', {\n  cancelToken: new CancelToken(function executor(c) {\n    // An executor function receives a cancel function as a parameter\n    cancel = c;\n  })\n});\n\n// cancel the request\ncancel();\n```\n\n> **Note:** you can cancel several requests with the same cancel token/abort controller.\n> If a cancellation token is already cancelled at the moment of starting an Axios request, then", "d at the moment of starting an Axios request, then the request is cancelled immediately, without any attempts to make a real request.\n\n> During the transition period, you can use both cancellation APIs, even for the same request:\n\n## Using `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` format\n\n### URLSearchParams\n\nBy default, axios serializes JavaScript objects to `JSON`. To send data in the [`application/x-www-form-urlencoded` format](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST) instead, you can us", "US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST) instead, you can use the [`URLSearchParams`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLSearchParams) API, which is [supported](http://www.caniuse.com/#feat=urlsearchparams) in the vast majority of browsers,and [ Node](https://nodejs.org/api/url.html#url_class_urlsearchparams) starting with v10 (released in 2018).\n\n```js\nconst params = new URLSearchParams({ foo: 'bar' });\nparams.append('extraparam', 'value');\naxios.post('/foo', params);\n```\n\n### Query string (Older br", "t('/foo', params);\n```\n\n### Query string (Older browsers)\n\nFor compatibility with very old browsers, there is a [polyfill](https://github.com/WebReflection/url-search-params) available (make sure to polyfill the global environment).\n\nAlternatively, you can encode data using the [`qs`](https://github.com/ljharb/qs) library:\n\n```js\nconst qs = require('qs');\naxios.post('/foo', qs.stringify({ 'bar': 123 }));\n```\n\nOr in another way (ES6),\n\n```js\nimport qs from 'qs';\nconst data = { 'bar': 123 };\nconst options = {", "s';\nconst data = { 'bar': 123 };\nconst options = {\n  method: 'POST',\n  headers: { 'content-type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' },\n  data: qs.stringify(data),\n  url,\n};\naxios(options);\n```\n\n### Older Node.js versions\n\nFor older Node.js engines, you can use the [`querystring`](https://nodejs.org/api/querystring.html) module as follows:\n\n```js\nconst querystring = require('querystring');\naxios.post('https://something.com/', querystring.stringify({ foo: 'bar' }));\n```\n\nYou can also use the [`qs`](https://", "ar' }));\n```\n\nYou can also use the [`qs`](https://github.com/ljharb/qs) library.\n\n> **Note**: The `qs` library is preferable if you need to stringify nested objects, as the `querystring` method has [known issues](https://github.com/nodejs/node-v0.x-archive/issues/1665) with that use case.\n\n### \ud83c\udd95 Automatic serialization to URLSearchParams\n\nAxios will automatically serialize the data object to urlencoded format if the content-type header is set to \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\".\n\n```js\nconst data = {\n  x", "/x-www-form-urlencoded\".\n\n```js\nconst data = {\n  x: 1,\n  arr: [1, 2, 3],\n  arr2: [1, [2], 3],\n  users: [{name: 'Peter', surname: 'Griffin'}, {name: 'Thomas', surname: 'Anderson'}],\n};\n\nawait axios.postForm('https://postman-echo.com/post', data,\n  {headers: {'content-type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'}}\n);\n```\n\nThe server will handle it as:\n\n```js\n  {\n    x: '1',\n    'arr[]': [ '1', '2', '3' ],\n    'arr2[0]': '1',\n    'arr2[1][0]': '2',\n    'arr2[2]': '3',\n    'arr3[]': [ '1', '2', '3' ],\n    'users[", " '3',\n    'arr3[]': [ '1', '2', '3' ],\n    'users[0][name]': 'Peter',\n    'users[0][surname]': 'griffin',\n    'users[1][name]': 'Thomas',\n    'users[1][surname]': 'Anderson'\n  }\n````\n\nIf your backend body-parser (like `body-parser` of `express.js`) supports nested objects decoding, you will get the same object on the server-side automatically\n\n```js\n  var app = express();\n\n  app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true })); // support encoded bodies\n\n  app.post('/', function (req, res, next) {\n     // ech", ".post('/', function (req, res, next) {\n     // echo body as JSON\n     res.send(JSON.stringify(req.body));\n  });\n\n  server = app.listen(3000);\n```\n\n## Using `multipart/form-data` format\n\n### FormData\n\nTo send the data as a `multipart/formdata` you need to pass a formData instance as a payload.\nSetting the `Content-Type` header is not required as Axios guesses it based on the payload type.\n\n```js\nconst formData = new FormData();\nformData.append('foo', 'bar');\n\naxios.post('https://httpbin.org/post', formData);", "\naxios.post('https://httpbin.org/post', formData);\n```\n\nIn node.js, you can use the [`form-data`](https://github.com/form-data/form-data) library as follows:\n\n```js\nconst FormData = require('form-data');\n\nconst form = new FormData();\nform.append('my_field', 'my value');\nform.append('my_buffer', new Buffer(10));\nform.append('my_file', fs.createReadStream('/foo/bar.jpg'));\n\naxios.post('https://example.com', form)\n```\n\n### \ud83c\udd95 Automatic serialization to FormData\n\nStarting from `v0.27.0`, Axios supports automatic", "\nStarting from `v0.27.0`, Axios supports automatic object serialization to a FormData object if the request `Content-Type`\nheader is set to `multipart/form-data`.\n\nThe following request will submit the data in a FormData format (Browser & Node.js):\n\n```js\nimport axios from 'axios';\n\naxios.post('https://httpbin.org/post', {x: 1}, {\n  headers: {\n    'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data'\n  }\n}).then(({data}) => console.log(data));\n```\n\nIn the `node.js` build, the ([`form-data`](https://github.com/form-data/for", "he ([`form-data`](https://github.com/form-data/form-data)) polyfill is used by default.\n\nYou can overload the FormData class by setting the `env.FormData` config variable,\nbut you probably won't need it in most cases:\n\n```js\nconst axios = require('axios');\nvar FormData = require('form-data');\n\naxios.post('https://httpbin.org/post', {x: 1, buf: new Buffer(10)}, {\n  headers: {\n    'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data'\n  }\n}).then(({data}) => console.log(data));\n```\n\nAxios FormData serializer supports some spe", ";\n```\n\nAxios FormData serializer supports some special endings to perform the following operations:\n\n- `{}` - serialize the value with JSON.stringify\n- `[]` - unwrap the array-like object as separate fields with the same key\n\n> **Note**: unwrap/expand operation will be used by default on arrays and FileList objects\n\nFormData serializer supports additional options via `config.formSerializer: object` property to handle rare cases:\n\n- `visitor: Function` - user-defined visitor function that will be called recu", "-defined visitor function that will be called recursively to serialize the data object\nto a `FormData` object by following custom rules.\n\n- `dots: boolean = false` - use dot notation instead of brackets to serialize arrays and objects;\n\n- `metaTokens: boolean = true` - add the special ending (e.g `user{}: '{\"name\": \"John\"}'`) in the FormData key.\nThe back-end body-parser could potentially use this meta-information to automatically parse the value as JSON.\n\n- `indexes: null|false|true = false` - controls how", " `indexes: null|false|true = false` - controls how indexes will be added to unwrapped keys of `flat` array-like objects\n\n    - `null` - don't add brackets (`arr: 1`, `arr: 2`, `arr: 3`)\n    - `false`(default) - add empty brackets (`arr[]: 1`, `arr[]: 2`, `arr[]: 3`)\n    - `true` - add brackets with indexes  (`arr[0]: 1`, `arr[1]: 2`, `arr[2]: 3`)\n\nLet's say we have an object like this one:\n\n```js\nconst obj = {\n  x: 1,\n  arr: [1, 2, 3],\n  arr2: [1, [2], 3],\n  users: [{name: 'Peter', surname: 'Griffin'}, {nam", " users: [{name: 'Peter', surname: 'Griffin'}, {name: 'Thomas', surname: 'Anderson'}],\n  'obj2{}': [{x:1}]\n};\n```\n\nThe following steps will be executed by the Axios serializer internally:\n\n```js\nconst formData = new FormData();\nformData.append('x', '1');\nformData.append('arr[]', '1');\nformData.append('arr[]', '2');\nformData.append('arr[]', '3');\nformData.append('arr2[0]', '1');\nformData.append('arr2[1][0]', '2');\nformData.append('arr2[2]', '3');\nformData.append('users[0][name]', 'Peter');\nformData.append('us", "nd('users[0][name]', 'Peter');\nformData.append('users[0][surname]', 'Griffin');\nformData.append('users[1][name]', 'Thomas');\nformData.append('users[1][surname]', 'Anderson');\nformData.append('obj2{}', '[{\"x\":1}]');\n```\n\nAxios supports the following shortcut methods: `postForm`, `putForm`, `patchForm`\nwhich are just the corresponding http methods with the `Content-Type` header preset to `multipart/form-data`.\n\n## Files Posting\n\nYou can easily submit a single file:\n\n```js\nawait axios.postForm('https://httpbin", "file:\n\n```js\nawait axios.postForm('https://httpbin.org/post', {\n  'myVar' : 'foo',\n  'file': document.querySelector('#fileInput').files[0]\n});\n```\n\nor multiple files as `multipart/form-data`:\n\n```js\nawait axios.postForm('https://httpbin.org/post', {\n  'files[]': document.querySelector('#fileInput').files\n});\n```\n\n`FileList` object can be passed directly:\n\n```js\nawait axios.postForm('https://httpbin.org/post', document.querySelector('#fileInput').files)\n```\n\nAll files will be sent with the same field names: ", "All files will be sent with the same field names: `files[]`.\n\n## \ud83c\udd95 HTML Form Posting (browser)\n\nPass HTML Form element as a payload to submit it as `multipart/form-data` content.\n\n```js\nawait axios.postForm('https://httpbin.org/post', document.querySelector('#htmlForm'));\n```\n\n`FormData` and `HTMLForm` objects can also be posted as `JSON` by explicitly setting the `Content-Type` header to `application/json`:\n\n```js\nawait axios.post('https://httpbin.org/post', document.querySelector('#htmlForm'), {\n  headers", ", document.querySelector('#htmlForm'), {\n  headers: {\n    'Content-Type': 'application/json'\n  }\n})\n```\n\nFor example, the Form\n\n```html\n<form id=\"form\">\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"foo\" value=\"1\">\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"deep.prop\" value=\"2\">\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"deep prop spaced\" value=\"3\">\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"baz\" value=\"4\">\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"baz\" value=\"5\">\n\n  <select name=\"user.age\">\n    <option value=\"value1\">Value 1</option>\n    <option value=\"value2\" selected>Value 2</option>\n", " <option value=\"value2\" selected>Value 2</option>\n    <option value=\"value3\">Value 3</option>\n  </select>\n\n  <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Save\">\n</form>\n```\n\nwill be submitted as the following JSON object:\n\n```js\n{\n  \"foo\": \"1\",\n  \"deep\": {\n    \"prop\": {\n      \"spaced\": \"3\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"baz\": [\n    \"4\",\n    \"5\"\n  ],\n  \"user\": {\n    \"age\": \"value2\"\n  }\n}\n````\n\nSending `Blobs`/`Files` as JSON (`base64`) is not currently supported.\n\n## \ud83c\udd95 Progress capturing\n\nAxios supports both browser and node environments to ", "os supports both browser and node environments to capture request upload/download progress.\n\n```js    \nawait axios.post(url, data, {\n  onUploadProgress: function (axiosProgressEvent) {\n    /*{\n      loaded: number;\n      total?: number;\n      progress?: number; // in range [0..1]\n      bytes: number; // how many bytes have been transferred since the last trigger (delta)\n      estimated?: number; // estimated time in seconds\n      rate?: number; // upload speed in bytes\n      upload: true; // upload sign\n   ", "ed in bytes\n      upload: true; // upload sign\n    }*/\n  },\n\n  onDownloadProgress: function (axiosProgressEvent) {\n    /*{\n      loaded: number;\n      total?: number;\n      progress?: number;\n      bytes: number; \n      estimated?: number;\n      rate?: number; // download speed in bytes\n      download: true; // download sign\n    }*/\n  }\n});  \n```\n\nYou can also track stream upload/download progress in node.js:\n\n```js\nconst {data} = await axios.post(SERVER_URL, readableStream, {\n   onUploadProgress: ({progres", ", readableStream, {\n   onUploadProgress: ({progress}) => {\n     console.log((progress * 100).toFixed(2));\n   },\n  \n   headers: {\n    'Content-Length': contentLength\n   },\n\n   maxRedirects: 0 // avoid buffering the entire stream\n});\n````\n\n> **Note:**\n> Capturing FormData upload progress is not currently supported in node.js environments.\n\n> **\u26a0\ufe0f Warning**\n> It is recommended to disable redirects by setting maxRedirects: 0 to upload the stream in the **node.js** environment,\n> as follow-redirects package will", "** environment,\n> as follow-redirects package will buffer the entire stream in RAM without following the \"backpressure\" algorithm.\n\n\n## \ud83c\udd95 Rate limiting\n\nDownload and upload rate limits can only be set for the http adapter (node.js):\n\n```js\nconst {data} = await axios.post(LOCAL_SERVER_URL, myBuffer, {\n  onUploadProgress: ({progress, rate}) => {\n    console.log(`Upload [${(progress*100).toFixed(2)}%]: ${(rate / 1024).toFixed(2)}KB/s`)\n  },\n   \n  maxRate: [100 * 1024], // 100KB/s limit\n});\n```\n\n## \ud83c\udd95 AxiosHeade", "* 1024], // 100KB/s limit\n});\n```\n\n## \ud83c\udd95 AxiosHeaders\n\nAxios has its own `AxiosHeaders` class to manipulate headers using a Map-like API that guarantees caseless work.\nAlthough HTTP is case-insensitive in headers, Axios will retain the case of the original header for stylistic reasons\nand for a workaround when servers mistakenly consider the header's case.\nThe old approach of directly manipulating headers object is still available, but deprecated and not recommended for future usage.\n\n### Working with header", "mmended for future usage.\n\n### Working with headers\n\nAn AxiosHeaders object instance can contain different types of internal values. that control setting and merging logic.\nThe final headers object with string values is obtained by Axios by calling the `toJSON` method.\n\n> Note: By JSON here we mean an object consisting only of string values intended to be sent over the network.\n\nThe header value can be one of the following types:\n- `string` - normal string value that will be sent to the server\n- `null` - sk", "alue that will be sent to the server\n- `null` - skip header when rendering to JSON\n- `false` - skip header when rendering to JSON, additionally indicates that `set` method must be called with `rewrite` option set to `true`\n  to overwrite this value (Axios uses this internally to allow users to opt out of installing certain headers like `User-Agent` or `Content-Type`)\n- `undefined` - value is not set\n\n> Note: The header value is considered set if it is not equal to undefined.\n\nThe headers object is always in", "ual to undefined.\n\nThe headers object is always initialized inside interceptors and transformers:\n\n```ts\n  axios.interceptors.request.use((request: InternalAxiosRequestConfig) => {\n      request.headers.set('My-header', 'value');\n\n      request.headers.set({\n        \"My-set-header1\": \"my-set-value1\",\n        \"My-set-header2\": \"my-set-value2\"\n      });\n      \n      request.headers.set('User-Agent', false); // disable subsequent setting the header by Axios\n\n      request.headers.setContentType('text/plain');\n", "    request.headers.setContentType('text/plain');\n    \n      request.headers['My-set-header2'] = 'newValue' // direct access is deprecated\n    \n      return request;\n    }\n  );\n````\n\nYou can iterate over an `AxiosHeaders` instance using a `for...of` statement:\n\n````js\nconst headers = new AxiosHeaders({\n  foo: '1',\n  bar: '2',\n  baz: '3'\n});\n\nfor(const [header, value] of headers) {\n  console.log(header, value);\n}\n\n// foo 1\n// bar 2\n// baz 3\n````\n\n### new AxiosHeaders(headers?)\n\nConstructs a new `AxiosHeaders", "sHeaders(headers?)\n\nConstructs a new `AxiosHeaders` instance. \n\n```\nconstructor(headers?: RawAxiosHeaders | AxiosHeaders | string);\n```\n\nIf the headers object is a string, it will be parsed as RAW HTTP headers.\n\n````js\nconst headers = new AxiosHeaders(`\nHost: www.bing.com\nUser-Agent: curl/7.54.0\nAccept: */*`);\n\nconsole.log(headers);\n\n// Object [AxiosHeaders] {\n//   host: 'www.bing.com',\n//   'user-agent': 'curl/7.54.0',\n//   accept: '*/*'\n// }\n````\n\n### AxiosHeaders#set\n\n```ts\nset(headerName, value: Axios, ", "sHeaders#set\n\n```ts\nset(headerName, value: Axios, rewrite?: boolean);\nset(headerName, value, rewrite?: (this: AxiosHeaders, value: string, name: string, headers: RawAxiosHeaders) => boolean);\nset(headers?: RawAxiosHeaders | AxiosHeaders | string, rewrite?: boolean);\n```\n\nThe `rewrite` argument controls the overwriting behavior:\n- `false` - do not overwrite if header's value is set (is not `undefined`)\n- `undefined` (default) - overwrite the header unless its value is set to `false`\n- `true` - rewrite anyway", " value is set to `false`\n- `true` - rewrite anyway\n\nThe option can also accept a user-defined function that determines whether the value should be overwritten or not.\n\nReturns `this`.\n\n### AxiosHeaders#get(header)\n\n```\n  get(headerName: string, matcher?: true | AxiosHeaderMatcher): AxiosHeaderValue;\n  get(headerName: string, parser: RegExp): RegExpExecArray | null;\n````\n\nReturns the internal value of the header. It can take an extra argument to parse the header's value with `RegExp.exec`,\nmatcher function o", "der's value with `RegExp.exec`,\nmatcher function or internal key-value parser.\n\n```ts\nconst headers = new AxiosHeaders({\n  'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data; boundary=Asrf456BGe4h'\n});\n\nconsole.log(headers.get('Content-Type')); \n// multipart/form-data; boundary=Asrf456BGe4h\n\nconsole.log(headers.get('Content-Type', true)); // parse key-value pairs from a string separated with \\s,;= delimiters:\n// [Object: null prototype] {\n//   'multipart/form-data': undefined,\n//    boundary: 'Asrf456BGe4h'\n// }\n\n\nconsol", "ined,\n//    boundary: 'Asrf456BGe4h'\n// }\n\n\nconsole.log(headers.get('Content-Type', (value, name, headers) => {\n  return String(value).replace(/a/g, 'ZZZ');\n}));\n// multipZZZrt/form-dZZZtZZZ; boundZZZry=Asrf456BGe4h\n\nconsole.log(headers.get('Content-Type', /boundary=(\\w+)/)?.[0]);\n// boundary=Asrf456BGe4h\n\n```\n\nReturns the value of the header.\n\n### AxiosHeaders#has(header, matcher?)\n\n```\nhas(header: string, matcher?: AxiosHeaderMatcher): boolean;\n```\n\nReturns `true` if the header is set (has no `undefined` ", "s `true` if the header is set (has no `undefined` value).\n\n### AxiosHeaders#delete(header, matcher?)\n\n```\ndelete(header: string | string[], matcher?: AxiosHeaderMatcher): boolean;\n```\n\nReturns `true` if at least one header has been removed.\n\n### AxiosHeaders#clear(matcher?)\n\n```\nclear(matcher?: AxiosHeaderMatcher): boolean;\n```\n\nRemoves all headers. \nUnlike the `delete` method matcher, this optional matcher will be used to match against the header name rather than the value.\n\n```ts\nconst headers = new Axios", "r than the value.\n\n```ts\nconst headers = new AxiosHeaders({\n  'foo': '1',\n  'x-foo': '2',\n  'x-bar': '3',\n});\n\nconsole.log(headers.clear(/^x-/)); // true\n\nconsole.log(headers.toJSON()); // [Object: null prototype] { foo: '1' }\n```\n\nReturns `true` if at least one header has been cleared.\n\n### AxiosHeaders#normalize(format);\n\nIf the headers object was changed directly, it can have duplicates with the same name but in different cases.\nThis method normalizes the headers object by combining duplicate keys into o", " headers object by combining duplicate keys into one.\nAxios uses this method internally after calling each interceptor.\nSet `format` to true for converting headers name to lowercase and capitalize the initial letters (`cOntEnt-type` => `Content-Type`)\n\n```js\nconst headers = new AxiosHeaders({\n  'foo': '1',\n});\n\nheaders.Foo = '2';\nheaders.FOO = '3';\n\nconsole.log(headers.toJSON()); // [Object: null prototype] { foo: '1', Foo: '2', FOO: '3' }\nconsole.log(headers.normalize().toJSON()); // [Object: null prototyp", "s.normalize().toJSON()); // [Object: null prototype] { foo: '3' }\nconsole.log(headers.normalize(true).toJSON()); // [Object: null prototype] { Foo: '3' }\n```\n\nReturns `this`.\n\n### AxiosHeaders#concat(...targets)\n\n```\nconcat(...targets: Array<AxiosHeaders | RawAxiosHeaders | string | undefined | null>): AxiosHeaders;\n```\n\nMerges the instance with targets into a new `AxiosHeaders` instance.

For example `0.5.1`, and `0.5.4` will have the same API, but `0.6.0` will have breaking changes.\n\n## Promises\n\naxios depends on a native ES6 Promise implementation to be [supported](https://canius", "se implementation to be [supported](https://caniuse.com/promises).\nIf your environment doesn't support ES6 Promises, you can [polyfill](https://github.com/jakearchibald/es6-promise).\n\n## TypeScript\n\naxios includes [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org) definitions and a type guard for axios errors.\n\n```typescript\nlet user: User = null;\ntry {\n  const { data } = await axios.get('/user?ID=12345');\n  user = data.userDetails;\n} catch (error) {\n  if (axios.isAxiosError(error)) {\n    handleAxiosError(error);\n  }", "osError(error)) {\n    handleAxiosError(error);\n  } else {\n    handleUnexpectedError(error);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nBecause axios dual publishes with an ESM default export and a CJS `module.exports`, there are some caveats.\nThe recommended setting is to use `\"moduleResolution\": \"node16\"` (this is implied by `\"module\": \"node16\"`). Note that this requires TypeScript 4.7 or greater.\nIf use ESM, your settings should be fine.\nIf you compile TypeScript to CJS and you can\u2019t use `\"moduleResolution\": \"node 16\"`, you have to enab", " `\"moduleResolution\": \"node 16\"`, you have to enable `esModuleInterop`.\nIf you use TypeScript to type check CJS JavaScript code, your only option is to use `\"moduleResolution\": \"node16\"`.\n\n## Online one-click setup\n\nYou can use Gitpod, an online IDE(which is free for Open Source) for contributing or running the examples online.\n\n[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/main/examples/server.js)\n\n\n## Resources\n\n* [Changelog](https:", "es/server.js)\n\n\n## Resources\n\n* [Changelog](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/v1.x/CHANGELOG.md)\n* [Ecosystem](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/v1.x/ECOSYSTEM.md)\n* [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/v1.x/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n* [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/v1.x/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n\n## Credits\n\naxios is heavily inspired by the [$http service](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$http) provided in [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/).

To address this challenge, we have developed a solution that allows users to express their queries in human language.Our project's data dialogue utilizes DeltaV to power the user interface, br", "ue utilizes DeltaV to power the user interface, bridging users and registered agents within the Agentverse. Users input two fields: the query and the database link they wish to query. This information is then processed by the fetch.ai *uagent, which invokes an API equipped with the logic to extract data from the specified database. The API leverages *Gemini LLM to translate the user's query into the appropriate syntax. Additionally, SQL Alchemy facilitates querying across various database types such as MYSQ", "uerying across various database types such as MYSQL, PostgreSQL, etc. The resulting query output is then formatted back into human-readable language using Gemini LLM before being sent back to the user interface via the uagent. This system empowers users to interact with databases without requiring expertise in Query Languages.Problem StatementTraditional methods of querying databases require users to have knowledge of query languages such as SQL. This can be a barrier for non-technical users who may not be ", " a barrier for non-technical users who may not be familiar with these languages. Our project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for querying databases using natural language.SolutionOur solution is a web-based interface that allows users to input queries in natural language. The system then processes the query and extracts data from the specified database. The user is presented with the query results in a human-readable format, eliminating the need for users to learn complex query languages.\u00a9 2025 Al", "r users to learn complex query languages.\u00a9 2025 All Rights Reserved.Made with love \u2764\ufe0f by ParthMainHomeInfoContactResumeGitHubLinkedInMailLast updated by Parth on June 15, 2024\n\n--- Content from https://parthsali.vercel.app/projects/create-xpress-starter ---\nParth Sali BackLINKSLiveGitHubCreate Xpress Starter - 2024OverviewCreate Xpress Starter is a customizable boilerplate for Express.js projects.
